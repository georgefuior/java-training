I made a project for creating and displaying different types of sportiv championships based on sport type.
For initial puropose I chosed 3 types of sport: Football, Handball and Basketball

The project model consists in different type of entities:
    - Sportiv people (Coach and Player)
    - Team of players and coach
    - Championship of teams from same sport type.
    - Stages of championships
    - Matches of stages
    - Score of matches

Design pattern used:
    -Abstract Factory (to create championships and teams based on a specific file with championship name and teams of that championship and based on sport type)
    -Builder ( to build players with additional proprieties lik age, attacking points, defensive points, etc)

To be continued:
    - Generate match schedule for every championship
